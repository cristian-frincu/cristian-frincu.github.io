## About

Graduated engineering with a focus on mechatronics.
I am interested in robotics and how statistics can make algorithms work smoother, the limitations of this approach and when it might be advantageous. 

A tinkerer at heart, I enjoy playing with a multitude of electronics and micro-controllers.

My non engineering interests include psychology, philosophy, economics and statistics.
