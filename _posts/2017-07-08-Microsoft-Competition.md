## Won first place in the Microsoft indoor competition 2017!

Along with the lab from McMaster, we won first place in the infrastructure less problem. 
The solution is largely based on PDR and Wifi. We are using a particle filter for estimating the position of the user. 
The contribution from our approach is that we are using a robotic platform to collect the training data for the wifi solution. The increased size size of labeled wifi data leads to more robust models of the underlying wifi distribution.
