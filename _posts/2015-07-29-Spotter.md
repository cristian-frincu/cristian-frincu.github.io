## Spotter - Your fitness buddy
Lately I have been focus on fitness and working out. This has lead me to blending my hobby and my passion, and I ended up creating what I call Spotter. For people who are not familiar with working out, a spotter is a friend who is there to help you make sure you have proper form and you do not injure yourself while lifting weights.
Spotter is a device that records the movement of the weight as you lift it, and you receive real time feedback about your performance. The device tells you things like "Go slower", "Go faster", "2 more times!" or "You are using bad form, readjust your position".
At the heart of Spotter is an Arduino Uno, connected to a bluetooth module and an accelerometer. By recording the data, and doing some fancy math, I am able to determine how fast you are moving, how many times you've repeated the motion and if you are moving in a direction that is not desirable.
I am still in the prototyping phase, but all of the mentioned features are working.
The only thing missing is a form factor that is pleasant and durable enough to throw around in your gym bag.
